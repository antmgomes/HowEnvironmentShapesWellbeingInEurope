# Greener, Denser, Hotter: How Environment Shapes Wellbeing in Europe

## Introduction:
This project explores how environmental and demographic factors relate to well-being outcomes across European countries between 2015 and 2023. The analysis examines whether greener environments, population characteristics, and climate conditions are associated with happiness, health, longevity, and suicide rates.
The goal of this project is not to establish causality, but to identify consistent associations and patterns that help explain cross-country differences in well-being.

## Hypotheses:
**1: Is higher environmental greenness (NDVI) associated with lower population density across countries?**
H₀: There is no association between NDVI and population density.
H₁: Countries with higher NDVI have lower population density.

**2: What is the relationship between environmental greenness (NDVI) and average annual mean temperature?**
H₀: NDVI is not correlated with average annual mean temperature.
H₁: NDVI is negatively correlated with average annual mean temperature (greener countries have cooler temperatures).

**3: Are countries with higher environmental greenness associated with better self-reported population health?**
H₀: NDVI is not associated with the percentage of the population reporting good or very good health.
H₁: Countries with higher NDVI have a higher percentage of people reporting good or very good health.

**4: Is environmental greenness associated with higher life expectancy at birth?**
H₀: NDVI is not associated with life expectancy at birth.
H₁: Countries with higher NDVI have higher life expectancy at birth.

**5: Is perceived population health more strongly associated with national happiness than life expectancy?**
H₀: Perceived population health is not more strongly associated with national happiness than life expectancy.
H₁: Perceived population health is more strongly associated with national happiness than life expectancy.

**6: What is the relationship between suicide rates and national happiness scores across countries?**
H₀: Suicide rate is not associated with national happiness scores.
H₁: Higher suicide rates are associated with lower national happiness scores.

**7: Is average annual temperature associated with national happiness scores?**
H₀: Average annual mean temperature is not associated with national happiness scores.
H₁: Average annual mean temperature is associated with national happiness scores.
